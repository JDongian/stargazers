#starfield

A project to make lots of stars.

GitHub does not remove stars when accounts are deleted. Thus, proof-of-concept code.

Be nice. And use Python3 ))


## Update

GitHub is starting to catch on, labeling accounts as bots. Bot accounts have odd interactions with repos. They still give off alerts on the main page.

21/1/2016: I'm quite sure this bug still exists, however I suspect creating fake accounts is still difficult. Perhaps setting the user agent to something believeable would be effective.
